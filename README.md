# School-21
There is some of my subjects from School 21.

Projects in C:

Libft
This project is dedicated to writing my own C library: a set of functions that was a useful tool for the entire course. 
It contains many general purpose functions.

PrintF
At this project I wrote a library that contains ft_printf(), a function that will mimic the original printf().

GNL
At this project I wrote a function that returns a line read from a
file descriptor.

So_long
This project was a very small and simple 2D game.
I made work with MiniLibX library, sprites, and some other very basic gameplay elements.

Push_swap
This project was about make data sorted on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using the lowest possible number of actions.
